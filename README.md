aby# PERSONAL WEBSITE (V3)

## Description

This is the third version of my personal website. It is a static website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Why V3?

My personal website has gone through a few iterations. V1.0 never deployed and was a huge mess of nonsensical code. V2.0 was built with [React](https://react.dev/) and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). I was extremely happy with V2.0 for a bit until gathering performance metrics and realizing that it was a bit too heavy for my liking and a SPA was not the right tooling for my needs. 

With V3.0, I decided to rebuild with [Astro](https://astro.build/), utilizing a small bundle size and static generation. Also, with Astro, I was able to utilize [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), my favorite CSS framework, and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), a library I have been wanting to try out for a while, for Fine-grained reactivity and remarkable developer experience.

## Performance

I am extremely happy with the performance of this website. It is a static website with a bundle size of 6.5kb and a page size of 8.5kb. It scores a 100 on Lighthouse and a 100 on PageSpeed Insights. It is also a PWA and scores a 100 on the PWA audit.
